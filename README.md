# Snake
In this project, I created a screen with the library Turtle. 
With the up, down, right and, left button, the snake that gets created on your screen moves. 
There will be a peice of food randomly set on the screen for the snake to eat. 
Every time you eat a peice of food, your snake will get longer. 
The goal is to get the food without hitting the edges of the screen and to not bite your own tail when you get longer.
